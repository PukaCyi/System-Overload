# Vs. Eteled: System Overload | on Codename Engine
This is a personal project that I'm just working on my freetime, or literally whenever I want to. The thing will release when I feel like it's closely 1:1 with the original S.O. or if I begin to eventually give up.

## Warning
This is **NOT** a replacement for the original [System Overload](https://gamebanana.com/mods/477139) mod, but rather just to create an alternative option for people to play on low-end PCs. 
- The devs of System Overload have every right to request to take this down, because I never asked for approval, and because idk lmao.
- This is a **in-dev** project, and there will be a lot of missing, broken, or missed up shit all over the game. If you can, please either make a bug report, or a pull request (if you want to mess around with the source)
- Due to Github limitations, I cannot upload the cutscenes - you will have to import them manually. (Just copy the cutscenes from the original S.O. mod, create a new folder over here on CNE called videos, and copy and paste the videos - for Dream of Peace, rename the video to "dop")
