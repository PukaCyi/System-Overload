# Status
This project has been archived as of March 2024 (though I never officially archived it until just now, April 5th, 2024.) I'm no longer interested at this time in System Overload, or Wii Deleted You in its entirety and thus, this project is abandoned. If you happen to come across this project, and notice bugs, please fix them yourself.

# Vs. Eteled: System Overload | on Codename Engine
A personal project I was working on back then.

## Warning
This is **NOT** a replacement for the original [System Overload](https://gamebanana.com/mods/477139) mod but rather an alternative option for people to play on low-end PCs.
- The devs of System Overload have every right to request to take this down because I never asked for approval, and because idk lmao.
- This is an **in-dev** project, and there will be a lot of missing, broken, or messed up shit throughout the game. If you can, please either make a bug report or a pull request (if you want to mess around with the source).
- Due to GitHub limitations, I cannot upload the cutscenes - you will have to import them manually. (Just copy the cutscenes from the original S.O. mod, create a new folder here on CNE called videos, and copy and paste the videos - for Dream of Peace, rename the video to "dop")

# Installation
To play this mod, you'll need the following:
* The latest Codename Engine build
* Port (through [Releases](https://github.com/PukaCyi/System-Overload/releases) or [Packages](https://github.com/PukaCyi?tab=packages&repo_name=System-Overload) - if available)

## How to do that
Great! You're still dedicated to follow along - don't worry, you'll live, for this is easy!

* Download this entire repository:
  - Click on the latest release or press "Download ZIP" under Code. You'll need to unzip the entire thing, and paste the contents later.

* Create a GitHub account:
  - You'll need this to download artifacts from Actions, or you can use [Nightly](https://nightly.link/) if you prefer.

* Get Codename Engine:
  - Visit the Codename Engine repo and head to the [Actions](https://github.com/FNF-CNE-Devs/CodenameEngine/actions) page.

* Choose your build version:
  - Select your preferred platform (e.g., Windows, Linux, Mac).

* Find the correct version:
  - Look for the green check mark next to the first three boxes. Check the version text to make sure you're looking at the right build

* Download the build:
  - Scroll to "Artifacts" and select "Codename Engine" or "Update-(Version)" if you're updating. Download the zip file.
  - If you're updating your Codename Engine build, please note that things may break if your build is old. You can update the engine just by unzipping the Update-(Version) file and replacing the old build.

## Notice:
  - If you're on the official Codename Engine Discord server (recommend joining it if you're interested in the engine), you can also skip the hard stuff and get straight to downloading the engine [here](https://discordapp.com/channels/860561967383445535/1029120938559684668/1213555930151784518)

* Set Up:
  - Unzip the downloaded file and navigate to the "mods" folder. Create a new folder called "System Overload" and paste the entire mod stuff inside.

* Start up CNE:
  - Load Codename Engine, and have fun! (you might need to press [TAB] and load the mod)
