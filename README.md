# Vs. Eteled: System Overload | on Codename Engine

This is a personal project that I'm working on in my free time, or literally whenever I want to. The thing will fully be released when I feel it's closely 1:1 with the original S.O. or if I eventually give up.

## Warning
This is **NOT** a replacement for the original [System Overload](https://gamebanana.com/mods/477139) mod but rather an alternative option for people to play on low-end PCs.
- The devs of System Overload have every right to request to take this down because I never asked for approval, and because idk lmao.
- This is an **in-dev** project, and there will be a lot of missing, broken, or messed up shit throughout the game. If you can, please either make a bug report or a pull request (if you want to mess around with the source).
- Due to GitHub limitations, I cannot upload the cutscenes - you will have to import them manually. (Just copy the cutscenes from the original S.O. mod, create a new folder here on CNE called videos, and copy and paste the videos - for Dream of Peace, rename the video to "dop")

# Installation
To play this mod, you'll need the following:
* The latest Codename Engine build

## How to do that
Great! You're still dedicated to follow along - don't worry, you'll live, for this is easy!

* Download this entire repository:
  - Click on the latest release or press "Download ZIP" under Code. You'll need to unzip the entire thing, and paste the contents later.

* Create a GitHub account:
  - You'll need this to download artifacts from Actions, or you can use [Nightly](https://nightly.link/) if you prefer.

* Get the Codename Engine:
  - Visit the Codename Engine repo and head to the Actions page.

* Choose your build version:
  - Select your preferred platform (e.g., Windows, Linux, Mac). 

* Find the correct version:
  - Look for the green check mark next to the first three boxes. Check the version text to make sure you're looking at the right build

* Download the engine:
  - Scroll to "Artifacts" and select "Codename Engine" or "Update-(Version)" if you're updating. Download the zip file.
  - If you're updating your Codename Engine build, please note that things may break if your build is old. You can update the engine just by unzipping the Update-(Version) file and replacing the old build.

* Set Up:
  - Unzip the downloaded file and navigate to the "mods" folder. Create a new folder called "System Overload" and paste the entire mod stuff inside.

* Start up CNE:
  - Load Codename Engine, and have fun! (you might need to press [TAB] and load the mod)
